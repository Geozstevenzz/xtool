#warning("We should have a shared heartbeat internally")
// because otherwise if two connections are attempted simultaneously,
// the concurrent heartbeats will fail. Basically, let the interface
// continue to look like you have multiple HeartbeatHandlers, but
// internally maintain a refcount to a shared structure that maintains
// a common heartbeat while the refcount > 0.
//
// Or maybe take the abstraction up a layer to `Connection`, or somehow
// put it in USBMuxHandler? Since in fact that probably needs to be
// common too. In fact both of those things seem to basically be what
// the usbmuxd daemon does, so maybe refactor them into a single
// USBMuxDaemonShim or something, which internally has a single connection
// for each device. Alternatively, refactor `Connection` to behave like that?
